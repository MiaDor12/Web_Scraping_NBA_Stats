# Web Scraping NBA Stats
* In many projects it is hard to find the desired data in accessible and orderly files, and it is necessary to import the data yourself from the Internet using web scraping.
* In this mini-project, I wanted to learn and practice web scraping in general and specifically the BeautifulSoup library.
* I scraped several pages that contain NBA stats data and organized it as a labeled training dataset.
